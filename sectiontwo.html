        <h2>My Decade in Review</h2>

        <p class="text">
          I started this decade as a first-year college student fresh out of
          high school. I was 17, didn’t have a job, didn’t have any industry
          connections, and really didn’t know shit. And now you’re reading my
          blog! I would have been proud.
          <br /><br />
          I’ve told bits and pieces of my story on different podcasts. Now feels
          like an appropriate time to write down the parts that were most
          memorable to me.
          <br /><br />
          Every person’s story is unique and not directly reproducible. I’ve
          benefited immensely from the privilege of being born in an upper
          middle class family and looking like a typical coder stereotype.
          People took chances on me. Still, I hope that sharing my story can be
          helpful to compare our experiences. Even if our circumstances are too
          different, at least you might find some of it entertaining.
