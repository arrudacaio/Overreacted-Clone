          It was a late evening.
          <br />
          <br />My colleague has just checked in the code that they’ve been
          writing all week. We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and
          they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and
          ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.<br /><br />
          The code worked.<br /><br />
          But it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had
          a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different
          directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way.
          If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while
          resizing. There was a bunch of math.
